                <h2>Our Founder</h2>
                <p>Freddie's Secret Cereal Lounge was founded by our leader, Phredeigh Cereal-Lounge in late 2020. He has devoted his entire life (and afterlife) to giving the good people of America the cereal they so rightfully deserve and desire.</p>
                <p>Phredeigh originates from the bogs of Florida, where sources of cereal are few and far between. As a young lad, he wished for nothing more than the sugary sweetness that modern cereals can provide. As soon as he was of age, he left Florida with nothing but a bowl and a spoon in order to search for the legendary best time and place to eat a crisp bowl of cereal. After many months of walking, he settled in Boulder, Colorado, and found a nice home in Varsity Lake on the CU campus. He seized the oppurtunity to bring cereal to the people of the college town, and yet not many people would trust someone hiding under a bridge and offering them cereal. So he decided to make it official.</p>
                <p>Phredeigh worked hard to establish the Three Foundational Rules of Cereal, which are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cereal should never be denied to those who are hungry.</li>
                        <li>Cereal is meant to be shared amongst friends.</li>
                        <li>Cereal is best enjoyed at 3am.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>In a sad turn of events, in early 2021, Phredeigh passed away. Investigations into his death are still open, however the leading theory is that he drowned in his own cereal. We don't believe that. We suspect foul play.</p>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>Here at the Lounge, we seek to honor Phredeigh's vision, and bring late night cereal to the people. As such, we remain open for only the oddest hours of the night. We only offer the highest quality and highest calorie cereals, so you will never be disappointed.</p>
                <p>Customer experience is second only to Good Cereal. We want our customers to leave the Lounge wondering what they have just gone through, and whether it was real or just a fever dream.</p>
                <p>In order to keep the oddity that is the Lounge as is, there are special instructions for entering. If you've read this far, congratulations! Here are the true directions to enter the Lounge:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stand on the bridge exactly half an hour before you would like to enter the Lounge.</li>
                    <li>Scream into the void.</li>
                    <li>A turtle will emerge from below the bridge, follow it.</li>
                    <li>You will hear an old man beckoning you away from the turtle. Ignore him. He does not have your best interests at heart.</li>
                </ol>
